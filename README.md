# Simple Arduino Weather Mood Lamp
This project uses a simple RGB led that outputs a certain colour based on the weather. The weather information will be extracted from the weather API without the use of an ethernet/internet shield. (Awesome if you're a broke student...like me XD)

Things you'll need:
1. Arduino UNO Board
2. RGB LED
3. some 270 ohm resistors (or about there)
4. wires
5. Processing software
6. Weather API (I'm living in Singapore, so naturally, I'll be using the SG weather API. Feel free to accomodate to your location's weather API!)

(will be updated again soon! :)
